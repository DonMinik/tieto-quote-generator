# Tieto Quote Generator

Tieto is a character from a pathfinder pen and paper campaign. He is a bard but instead of performing music or dancing he is more of a story teller. For this reason he always quotes a more or less encouraging sentence when casting a spell with the verbal trait. 
To get a fitting quote for his spells this generator chooses one and displays it.
